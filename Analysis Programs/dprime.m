function [d,c,p] = dprime(a,b,c,d)

%dprime.m - OU Neural Engineering Lab, 2008
%
%   dprime.m takes the number of hits, misses, false alarms, and correct
%   rejections and calculates the signal detection index d' ("d prime")
%   according to Green and Swet's signal detection theory.
%
%   dprime(H,M,F,C) returns the d' index calculated from the number of
%   hits (H), number of misses (M), number of false alarms (F), and number
%   of correct rejections (C).
%
%   [d, c] = dprime(H,M,F,C) returns the calculated d' index as well as
%   the associated bias measure c' ("c prime").
%
%   [d, c, p] = dprime(H,M,F,C) returns the calculated d' and c' as well
%   as 1 minues the the value of the normal cumulative distribution
%   function for the calculated d', approximately equivalent to a
%   statistical p value.
