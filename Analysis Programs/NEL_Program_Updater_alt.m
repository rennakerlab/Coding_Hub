function NEL_Program_Updater

%NEL_Program_Updater.m - UTD Neural Engineering Lab, 2009
%
%   NEL_Program_Updater synchronizes standard programs and files that the 
%   OU-NEL lab uses between the network drivespace (the Z:\ drive) and 
%   local folders on the desktop of NEL computers.  As a rule, programs and
%   files on the Z:\ drive are considered to be the "master" copies and
%   will override local copies on the desktop, unless those files show that
%   they have been modified more recently than the "master" copies, in
%   which case this program copies the newer program to the network drive
%   and saves a backup copy of the old program in the "Old Versions"
%   subfolder of every network drive folder.
